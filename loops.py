'''loops are used to excute a block of code 
repeatedlly as long as a certain condition 
is true or for a specific number of itereations'''

#while loop

''' the  while loop excutes a block of code as long as
specied condition is true.it continously checks the 
condition before each iteration and stops when 
the condition becomes false'''

#for loop
'''A for loop is a way repeat a block of code for each item 
in a collection or for a specific range of numbers'''
